# Generic Sensor API Demo (Magnetometer)

This is a demonstration of the [Generic Sensor API](https://www.w3.org/TR/generic-sensor/). This specific example uses the `Magnetometer` sensor to show the cardinal direction and heading.

The JavaScript code specific to the magnetometer can be found in `/public/scripts.js`, [here]().

The demo will only work on devices that have a magnetometer sensor and use Chrome version 67 or higher.
